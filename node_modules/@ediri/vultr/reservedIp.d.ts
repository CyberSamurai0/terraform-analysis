import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
/**
 * Provides a Vultr reserved IP resource. This can be used to create, read, modify, and delete reserved IP addresses on your Vultr account.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * Create a new reserved IP:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as vultr from "@ediri/vultr";
 *
 * const myReservedIp = new vultr.ReservedIp("myReservedIp", {
 *     ipType: "v4",
 *     label: "my-reserved-ip",
 *     region: "sea",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * Attach a reserved IP to a instance:
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as vultr from "@ediri/vultr";
 *
 * const myReservedIp = new vultr.ReservedIp("myReservedIp", {
 *     instanceId: "b9cc6fad-70b1-40ee-ab6a-4d622858962f",
 *     ipType: "v4",
 *     label: "my-reserved-ip",
 *     region: "sea",
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Reserved IPs can be imported using the reserved IP `ID`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import vultr:index/reservedIp:ReservedIp my_reserved_ip b9cc6fad-70b1-40ee-ab6a-4d622858962f
 * ```
